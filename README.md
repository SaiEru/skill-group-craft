# 🚀 PeerIQ – AI Powered Smart Skill Group Generator

PeerIQ is an intelligent team formation platform that uses Machine Learning to create optimal student groups based on skill similarity and diversity.

It goes beyond traditional clustering by focusing on smart, balanced team formation for collaborative projects, hackathons, and academic work.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Manual group formation often results in:

- Unbalanced skill distribution
- Overloaded high performers
- Poor collaboration efficiency
- Bias in selection

PeerIQ solves this using data-driven intelligent clustering.

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🔹 AI-Based Skill Clustering
- Uses K-Means clustering algorithm
- Groups students based on 40+ skill parameters
- Minimizes intra-group variance
- Maximizes collaboration potential

### 🔹 Balanced Team Strategy
- Designed to form optimized teams
- Ensures fair skill distribution
- Avoids extreme performance imbalance

### 🔹 AI Whiteboard (Upcoming Feature 🚧)
- Enter any concept (e.g., K-Means, Binary Search)
- AI visually explains the concept step-by-step
- Simulates real whiteboard teaching
- Animated diagrams + structured explanation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js

### Machine Learning
- Python
- Scikit-Learn (KMeans)
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Canvas API (for AI Whiteboard)

## 📊 How Clustering Works

1. Students' skill dataset is processed
2. Data is normalized
3. K-Means algorithm forms clusters
4. Students are assigned group labels
5. Teams are generated based on cluster output
